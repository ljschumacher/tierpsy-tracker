# Installation

First you have to clone this repository. I recommend to install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Then open a new terminal (in Windows open Git Shell) and run: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ver228/tierpsy-tracker
```
## Installation for OSX/Linux
- Run `bash installation/installation_script.sh`

## Installation for Windows

- Download and install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
- Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Friendly installation instructions can be found [here](http://adaptivesamples.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/).
- Install [Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools).
- Run `./tierpsy-tracker/installation/installation_script.bat`.

## Possible Issues
Most of the problems that can occur during the installation are due to missing/conflicting dependencies specially if there were older versions of miniconda installed. Try to upgrade and re-run the scripts. If the problem persist you can raise an issue I'll try to help you but most of the time the problems can be solved by doing a google search.

## Tests Examples
In OSX/Linux the test examples can be downloaded executing: 

```bash
installation/instalation_script.sh --tests
```
