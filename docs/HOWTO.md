# Manual

## Getting Started

After running the installation script in OSX or Windows there should be a clickable executable named `TierpsyTracker` on the Desktop. If the executable is missing you can re-create it by running:

```bash
#(OSX/Linux)
installation/installation_script.sh--link_desktop 

#(Windows)
installation/installation_script.bat --link_desktop
```  

Alternatively open a terminal, go to the directory where Tierpsy Tracker is installed and type: 

```bash
python3 cmd_scripts/TierpsyTrackerConsole.py
```

The main widget should look like the one below:

## Set Parameters

The purpose of this widget is to setup the parameters used for [Batch Processing Multiple Files](#batch-processing-multiple-files). The interface is designed to help select the parameters that determine how videos are [segmented and compressed](EXPLANATION.md/#compress). When imaging conditions such as lighting or magnification are changed, these parameters will need to be updated for good performance.

The most commonly adjusted parameter is the `Threshold`. If you have dark worms on a light background, `Is Light Background?` should be checked.  In this case, pixels that are darker than the threshold value will be included in the mask. The selected value should be low enough to exclude as much background as possible without losing any part of the animals to be tracked. Below there is an example on how to do this.

If the objects to track are lighter than the background (e.g. if you are tracking fluorescent objects or using dark field illumination), un-check `Is Light Background?`.  In this case, pixels that are above the threshold value will be included in the mask.

In some cases, even after adjusting the threshold there still remain large regions of background. If the tracked objects significatively change position during the movie you can enable the background subtraction as shown below. This method will consider anything that does not change within the specified frame range as background.  However, if any of your animals are immobile during the entire frame range will be lost. 

![SetBgndSubt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8364368/26410958/95a8c09a-409c-11e7-9fc9-14dafeabb467.gif)  

Other important parameters to set are:

* `Frame per Seconds` (fps) is the frame rate of your video. An important value since it is used to calculate several other parameters. If `Extract Timestamp` is set to `true`, the software will try to extract the frame rate from the video timestamp. However, keep in mind that it is not always possible to recover the correct timestamp, and therefore it is recommended that you provide the value here.
* `Frames to Average` is used to calculate the background mask. This value can significantly speed up the compression step. However, it will not work if the particles are highly motile. Use the buttons `Play` and `Next Chunk` to see how a selected value affects the mask. Note that the average is used only for the background mask, the foreground regions are kept intact for each individual frame. 
* `Microns per Pixels`. This value is only used to calculate the [skeleton features](EXPLANATION.md/#feat_create), but the results will be in pixels instead of micrometers if the conversion factor is not set.

You can access further parameters by clicking `Edit More Parameters`. The explanation of each parameter can be found by using the [contextual help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooltip). It is not always trivial to effectively adjust these other parameters, but if you believe you need too, I recommend using a small video (~100 frames) for testing.

When you are satisfied with the selected parameters select a file name and press `Save Parameters`. The parameters will be saved as a [JSON](http://json.org/) file that can be used in [Batch Processing Multiple Files](#batch-processing-multiple-files). If you need to further modify a parameter you can either use a text editor to change the JSON file directly or reload the file by dragging it into the Set Parameters widget.

## Batch Processing Multiple Files
![BatchProcessing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8364368/26605347/86ffb1e6-4585-11e7-9835-ffdc0751c67a.png)

This widget is used to execute [all steps](EXPLANATION.md) of tracking and feature extraction on each of the files on a given directory. The program allows a degree of parallelization by analyzing multiple files at the same time.  The number of processes to run in parallel (`Maximum Number of Processes`) should not exceed the number of processor cores available on your machine to avoid slowing down the analysis.


### Chosing the Files to be Analyzed
Tierpsy Tracker will analyse of the video files that are present in `Original Video Dir` including sub-directories.  Particular files are included if their names match the `File Pattern to Include`, but do not match the `File Pattern to Exclude`. 

* The patterns can use [Unix shell-style wildcards](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/fnmatch.html). 
* In order to distinguish the [output files](OUTPUTS.md) that are saved during processing, any file that ends with any of the [reserved suffixes](https://github.com/ver228/tierpsy-tracker/blob/master/tierpsy/helper/misc/file_processing.py#L5) will be ignored. 
* To analyze a single file set `File Pattern to Include` to the entire file name.
* If the `Analysis Start Point` is set to a step after [`COMPRESS`](EXPLANATION.md/#compress) the `Original Videos Dir` is ignored and the `Masked Videos Dir` is used instead.

Alternatively, one can create a text file with the list of files to be analysed (one file per line). The path to this file can then be set in `Individual File List`. 


### Analysis Progress 

Tierpsy Tracker will determine which analysis steps have already been completed for the selected files and will only execute the analysis from the last completed step. Files that were completed or do not satisfy the next step requirements will be ignored. 

* To see only a summary of the files to be analysed without starting the analysis tick `Only Display Progress Summary`.

* You can start or end the analysis at specific points by using the `Analysis Start Point` and `Analysis End Point` drop-down menus. 
* If you want to re-analyse a file from an earlier step, delete or rename the output files that were created during the previous run. If you only want to overwrite a particular step, you have to delete the corresponding step in the `/provenance_tracking` node in the corresponding file. 

### Directory to Save the Output Files
The masked videos created in the [compression step](EXPLANATION.md/#video-compression) are stored in `Masked Videos Dir`. The rest of the tracker results are stored in `Tracking Results Dir`. In both cases the subdirectory tree structure in `Original Videos Dir` is recreated. 

The reason for creating the parallel directory structure is to make it easy to delete the analysis outputs to re-run with different parameter values.  It also makes it easy to delete the original videos to save space once you've arrived at good parameter values. If you prefer to have the output files in the same directory as the original videos you can set `Masked Videos Dir` and `Tracking Results Dir` to the same value.

### Parameters Files
Parameters files created using the [Set Parameters](#set-parameters) widget can be select in the `Parameter Files` box. You can also select some previously created files using the drop-down list. If no file is selected the [default values](https://github.com/ver228/tierpsy-tracker/blob/dev/tierpsy/helper/params/docs_tracker_param.py) will be used. 

### Temporary directory
By default, Tierpsy Tracker creates files in the `Temporary Dir` and only moves them to the `Masked Videos Dir` or the `Tracking Results Dir` when the analysis has finished. The reasons to use a temporary directory are:

* Protect files from corruption due to an unexpected termination (crashes). HDF5 is particularly prone to get corrupted if a file was opened in write mode and not closed properly.
* Deal with unreliable connections. If you are using remote disks it is possible that the connection between the analysis computer and the data would be interrupted. A solution is to copy the required files locally before starting the analysis and copy the modified files back once is finished.

Some extra options:

* By default the original videos are not copied to the temporary directory for compression. These files can be quite large and since they would be read-only they do not require protection from corruption.  If you want copy the videos, tick `Copy Raw Videos to Temp Dir` box.

* In some cases the analysis will not finished correctly because some steps were not executed. If you still want to copy the files produced by the remaining steps to the final location tick the `Copy Unifnished Analysis` box.

### Command Line Tool

The same functions are accesible using the command line. You can see the available option by typing in the main tierpsy directory:
```
python cmd_scripts/processMultipleFiles.py -h
```

## Tierpsy Tracker Viewer

This widget is used to visualize the tracking results. You can move to a specific frame, zoom in/out, select specific trajectories, and visualize the skeletons overlayed on the compressed video, the trajectory paths or saved [unmasked frames](OUTPUTS.md#full_data). See below for an example on how to use it.

![MWTrackerViewer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8364368/26412511/eac27158-40a0-11e7-880c-5671c2c27099.gif)  

You can manually correct the trajectories as shown below. Once you have finished, execute the [FEAT\_MANUAL\_CREATE](EXPLANATION.md/#feat_manual_create) step using [Batch Processing Multiple Files](#batch-processing-multiple-files).
